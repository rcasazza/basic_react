# Examples of basic React app functionality

This project is based on the excellent course "Learn React for Modern Web Applications" by Shaun Wassell

## Basic Examples

- Create React Components
- Pass props to Components
- Render components Conditionally
- Display lists of Components
- Handle Clicks and other events
- Style Components in React
- Use State in Components
- Where to put State?
- Use Lifecycle Events in Components

## Routing in React Examples

- Setting up react-router
- Using URL and Query parameters
- Implement "not found" pages
- Redirect
- Navigate programmatically

## Common React Patterns

- Controlled and Uncontrolled Forms
- Navigation Sidebar
- Network Requests
- Using the Children prop

## React class-based Components for Comprehension, but never use for new development

- Class-based components
- Use-state within class-based components
- Lifecycle events in class-based components

## Clean React Code

- Inheritance and Composition (don't do inheritance!)
- SRP in React
- Anti-Patterns (bad smells)

  - Using props instead of props destructuring
  - Multi-function rendering over sub-components
  - Using index as key in lists
  - Using single object to hold state instead of multiple state hooks

## Advance React

- Using Context in a component hierarchy
- Persistant Data
- Custom Hooks
- Other React Boilerplate Options
  - NEXT.js (?)
  - Gatsby
  - react boilerplate
  - RAZZLE
